## Why This Tweak Exists

YouTube has never provided an official way to disable Shorts, despite numerous user requests. Shorts are designed to grab attention and encourage endless scrolling, which can be highly distracting.

**Benefits of SAtube:**

- Removes all Shorts videos from your main YouTube feed.
- Removes the Shorts tab/icon from the bottom navigation bar.
- Helps increase focus during study, work, or personal projects.
- Reduces the likelihood of falling into “binge-scrolling” sessions.
- Supports users in managing screen time and improving productivity.

This tweak is particularly helpful for students preparing for exams or anyone who wants to maximize focus without YouTube interruptions.
